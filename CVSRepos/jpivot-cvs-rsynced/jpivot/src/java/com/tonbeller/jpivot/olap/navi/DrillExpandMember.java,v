/**
 * allows to expand / collapse members on an axis. If a member is expanded, 
 * the member itself plus its children are displayed.
 * <p>
 * Example: if you expand "Europe" you may see "Germany", "France" etc.
 * If you collapse "Europe" the countries will not be shown.
 * <p>
 * If multiple Hierarchies are shown on a single axis, all positions
 * are expanded. For example
 * 
 * <pre>
 * -----+-------
 * 2001 | Europe
 * -----+-------
 * 2002 | Europe
 * -----+-------
 * 2003 | Europe
 * -----+-------
 * </pre>
 * 
 * clicking on Europe in 2002 will give

 * <pre>
 * -----+-------
 * 2001 | Europe
 *      |   Germany
 *      |   France
 * -----+-------
