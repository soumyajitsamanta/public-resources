/**
 * Manages state of JSPs.
 * <p />
 * Example: the user displays customerdetail.jsp for customer A, then productdetail.jsp for product B,
 * and then again customerdetail.jsp for customer C. What should happen to A and B at this point?
 * There are two possible strategies: stack and page.
 * <p />
 * PageStateStrategy preserves the latest state for every page. In the example A will be destroyed and 
 * B and C will be preserved. So the user can display the productdetails.jsp with B and the 
 * customerdetail.jsp with C using browser history buttons.
 * <p />
 * StackStateStrategy puts the pages into a stack. In the example, first customerdetail.jsp/A is pushed,
 * then productdetail.jsp/B is pushed. In the last step, productdetail.jsp is popped because there is
 * already a customerdetail.jsp on the stack. After productdetail.jsp is popped, the associated
 * value of customerdetail.jsp is changed from A to C. The stack will only contain the value C for
 * customerdetail.jsp, the values A and B will be destroyed.
