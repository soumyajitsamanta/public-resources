log
@This checkin changes the behavior when the of the integer property
"com.tonbeller.jpivot.mondrian.cell.limit" is set. Previously, if a
query returned more than the non-zero value of the property, a
limit exception was thrown. Now, the TableComponent simply only
renders that number of cells (rounding up to the nearest complete row).
In addition, there is a resource property "table.cell.limit"
which is the message put at the bottom of the table so generated
which spans the final row and allows one to show both the
value of the property and the total number of cells that would
have been shown had the property not been set. This allows
one to limit the size of the table generated thus preventing
OutOfMemory errors. Also note that in MondrianResult, only the
cell limit value (rounded up) of cells are read in from Mondrian since
only that number will be displayed.

The entire query returned {1,number} cells. To display the complete table, you can apply filters to the data, hide empty cells, or collapse some cells. Then, re-execute the query by refreshing the page. For more information, contact your application administrator.
