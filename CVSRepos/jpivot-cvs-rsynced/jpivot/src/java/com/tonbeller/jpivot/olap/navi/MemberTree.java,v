1.2
log
@Created two JPivot base exception classess, JPivotException and
JPivotRuntimeException, and all JPivot exceptions now have one of
these as parent class. The mondrian JPivot code now gets its
SchemaReader from the MDX query rather than the connection so that
the query's cube's calculated members and the query's defined
"with" members can be displayed.
Also, added new JPivot exception, NoValidMemberException, which is
throw when a query returns no data on one or more axis.
Lastly, cleaned up html generated by 2 transforms.
