text
@This directory contains the external libraries that JPivot and WCF depend on.

The directory structure should be the same as of the downloaded archives, e.g.
if you download xalan-2.7.0.zip and unzip, then the jar files will end up in 
the xalan/bin directory. 

This is because we simple unzip the whole distributions into this directory,
so we have sources and documentation too.
