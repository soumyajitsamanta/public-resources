@# allows for role mapping. Example
#   <wcf:form id="form1" role="form1Role" .../>
# here you can map form1Role to some existing role, e.g
# 	role.myForm1Role=expert
# so only users that belong to the J2EE role "expert" will 
# see form1
# 
# roles may be defined for 
#    components
#    toolbar buttons
#    individual fields in xml form descriptions (see formdemo.xml)
# 
# here you have to prepend "role." to the actual role name 
# (e.g. role.myForm1Role instead of just myForm1Role)
