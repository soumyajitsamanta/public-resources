@IE bugs:
selectHtmlElement covers drugged object or working dialog
	draged object becomes hidden when dragging over such element
	(eg Metric - Aggregation level)
shifted aligment
	first line of images is shifted right comparing to all other lines
	(eg Format-3D graph/graph, when more then 1 line)
inactive scrollbar in menu is visible
	scrollbar is viewed into the located area of the overflowing object, when set visible:auto,
	thus auto is contraproductive and scrollbars are alltime visible

tree-items do not change color, when mouse over
	no reason, sorry.


IE5 bug
drugged object is not shown
	iframes - tree and edit has unspecified high viewing priority (the object is moved behind them)

Mozilla 1.4 bug
saving object graph3d or grid colapse webbrowser
	no reason, sorry.
save and run does not open report in new window
	allow pop-up windows for Bear Web Site //menu: Tools-Popup manager-manage popups//

Netscape 7.x
like Mozilla

Opera 7.x
