Installing and setting up DAD daemon
------------------------------------

The BEE Project's architecture is distributed over several hosts.
On all these machines there must be running DAD server, daemon
gaining access to host's data sources or CPU resources.

In minimal case, you can run BEE only on one machine. Even so,
you need to run DAD daemon there!

You must install DAD daemon on all hosts you plan to use in
ETL process. Then you can use their's data or CPU resources.

To install DAD daemon to particular host, you will need to

  o  Copy installation tarball to these hosts
  o  Install all required packages and modules
     Note: You will not need Tk modules for DAD daemon.
  o  Compile and install libNet and libData

Now you can invoke DAD daemon using following commands:

    bash$ cd $BEEDIR/dad
    bash$ ./dad.pl
    listenning on port 2333

Consider automatical invoking of dad daemon on system startup.
DAD daemon do not require root priviledges, but all data sources,
that we wish to access (especially files stored on host's filesystem),
must be readable by user executing DAD!
