Accessible data sources
-----------------------

The primary role of an ETL process in Data Warehousing is to extract 
data from a remote dedicated host, clean, transform and filter data, 
provide quality checks and save them to warehouse.

Using BEE, you can access data, transform it using Perl scripting
language, and save to database.

Ability to access different types of data sources is very
important in the usability of ETL tools. 

The BEE Project uses DBI to access database tables and its own driver for
tables stored in CSV files. Other types are in development, but DBI 
offers lots of drivers for almost every database widely used. 

If you want to access your data stored in database, just ensure
you have perl's DBD module for that database installed on host where
some dad is running. 

After doing so, you can connect to tables using URL in form:

dbi-$dbd://user:password@@host:port/dbname/table:field1:field2...:fieldN

Note that $dbd stands for DBD driver name.

For accessing files, specify URL in form:

dir://localhost/path

Where path is ABSOLUTE path with filename to wanted file.

Accessing remote file-systems is not implemented in this version, so
if you want to work with a file, you must setup a dad and execute bees
on that remote host. 

In addition, you have to specify 'localhost' in URL, because we assume
that there will be posibility to access remote files not only using special
bees running on that host, but thru protocols like FTP, Samba, HTTP or so too.
