Dependencies
------------


The BEE Project depends on a number of third-party modules and libraries:

 o  OpenSSL library is used for network communication.
    Precompiled binaries of OpenSSL library are included in BEE 
    distribution tarball in $BEE/windows/openssl-0.9.7c.zip file.

	Extract and save files libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll to your
    Windows system directory c:\win??\system32

        ssleay32.dll
        libeay32.dll

 o  Perl 5.8.x interpreter

    Starting from Perl 5.005, the Win32 support has been integrated to the
    Perl standard source code distribution. If you want precompiled binaries,
    you can for example download ActiveState Perl distribution from:

    http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePerl

    From now on, we will assume that you have Perl installed in c:\perl,
    you have perl.exe in your PATH enviromnent variable and .pl extension
    is registered to perl interpreter binary correctly.

 o  Lots of other Perl modules are required. The simplest way is to
    use ActivePerl Package Manager tool named PPM. To install these
    modules, execute 'ppm' in command-box:

       c:\ ppm
       ppm> install XML-Parser
       ppm> install XML-Simple
       ppm> install FreezeThaw
       ppm> install Tk-FileDialog
       ppm> install Tk-Splash
       ppm> install DBI
       ppm> install DBD-mysql
	   ppm> install Tk-XMLViewer

    You will need DBD driver for every type of database you want to use, 
    see DBI homepage and ActivePerl PPM site for details:

       http://dbi.perl.org
       http://ppm.activestate.com
       http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.8-D.html

 o  libNet and libData.
    libNet and libData are BEE modules written in C language for
    network RPC communication and fast data transfers. 
    Precompiled binaries for these modules are stored in 
    $BEE/windows/bee-1.0-libs.zip file. Just extract content
    to $BEE/lib directory

       $BEE/lib/MSWin32-x86-multi-thread/*
       $BEE/lib/Data.pm
       $BEE/lib/Net.pm

If you made all these steps, you have your system prepared for running BEE.
