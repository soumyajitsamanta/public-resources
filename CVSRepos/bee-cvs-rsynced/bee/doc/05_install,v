Installation
------------

The BEE Project consists of client (GUI) and server (dad daemon) part. 

Several platforms are supported for dad daemon, including most
UNIX systems and Microsoft Windows.

Client part (GUI) is supported under Linux, but works fine under
Windows too.

Requirements and installation instructions differ between
product's parts and particular OS. In general, you will need
a working Perl interpreter, set of additional perl packages
(DBI for data access, Tk for graphical interface and others), 
and OpenSSL package for encrypted communication. Some parts of 
The BEE Project are written in C language, we will show how
to compile and install them too.

Note that for Microsoft Windows platform ALL binaries (except Perl 
itself and freely available Perl modules) are included.


Obtaining BEE package
---------------------

Distribution tarballs are freely available for download from project
homepage:

    http://bee.sourceforge.net

Alternatively you can use CVS repository hosted on sourceforge.net
to obtain actual sources. 

In UNIX environments, you can run the following command to obtain
the latest source codes in a directory that you have write access to 
(such as your home directory):

    bash$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/bee \
          checkout -P bee

You should see it listing all the source files.
    
From now on, we will assume you have source codes extracted in 
$BEEDIR directory.
