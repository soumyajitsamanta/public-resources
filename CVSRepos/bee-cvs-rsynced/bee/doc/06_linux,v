Dependencies
------------

The BEE Project depends on a number of third-party modules and libraries:

 o  OpenSSL library is used for network communication.
    You will need both OpenSSL runtime library and OpenSSL development
    packages in order to compile BEE.
    Note that particular installation steps deppend on your
    Linux distribution, but these packages are required:

        openssl
        libssl
        libssl-dev

 o  Expat library for parsing XML files

        libexpat-dev
 
 o  Perl 5.8.x intrepreter
    Major part of The BEE Project is written in Perl scripting
    language. You will need perl-5.8.x or later to run BEE.
    Note that perl-5.6.x is not supported and will not work!

        perl-5.8.0

 o  Lots of other Perl modules are required. They are not
    included in standard Perl interpreter, but are available
    from CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network).
    The simplest method to download, configure, make and install
    these modules is to use perl's built-in package manager:

        bash# perl -MCPAN -e shell

    Running this for the first time will ask you to configure 
	access to CPAN repository. 
    It's safe to run this as superuser and install freely available 
    packages system-wide.

    If you have no such permissions, you can install packages to your
    home directory by specifing another installation path during
    CPAN setup. Answer 'LIB=~/perl' when you are asked for parameters
    for 'perl Makefile.PL' by CPAN package manager setup:

        Parameters for the 'perl Makefile.PL' command?
        Typical frequently used settings:

          POLLUTE=1        increasing backwards compatibility
          LIB=~/perl       non-root users (please see manual for more hints)

        Your choice: []  LIB=~/perl

    In addition, you will need to specify this directory by adding 
    following line in every perl script you want to execute:

        use lib '/home/my_home/my_perl_modules';


    After a successful CPAN package manager configuration, you can 
    install packages by invoking these commands in the CPAN shell:

        cpan> install XML::Parser
        cpan> install XML::Simple
        cpan> install FreezeThaw

    Note that installing XML::Parser may fail if you don't have Expat
    library (including appropriate Expat development package).

  o DBI module and DBD database drivers. You will need a driver for
    every type of database you want to access. The BEE Project then
    access these drivers using DBI interface. To install DBI, issue
    the following in the CPAN package manager:

        cpan> install DBI

    To install DBD driver for your databases, be sure you have low level
	drivers for this database installed in your system.

    For example, widely used MySQL database DBD driver needs the following
    libraries already installed in your system:

        libmysqlclient6-dev
        mysql-dev
        mysql-devel
        mysql-gpl-dev
	
    Once you have low level libraries for your database installed,
    you can issue the following command to CPAN package manager:

        cpan> install DBD::mysql    # for MySQL database
        cpan> install DBD::Ingres   # for Ingress
        cpan> install DBD::ODBC     # for ODBC access

    You can check availability and installation steps for DBD driver
    for your database with DBI homepage 
	  
        http://dbi.perl.org

  o Perl Tk modules for GUI.
    BEE's client part (GUI) uses Tk user interface, so you must install
    these Perl Tk modules:

        cpan> install Tk
		cpan> install Tk::FileDialog
		cpan> install Tk::XMLViewer
        cpan> install Tk::Splash
		cpan> install Tk::XMLViewer
		cpan> install Tk::FileDialog



Compilation
-----------

Major part of The BEE Project is written as Perl scripts.
For efficiency, there are some minor parts written in C language
and they need to be compiled: 

 o  libNet -- RPC network communication
 
    To compile libNet, do following (note $BEEDIR is directory where
    you extracted distribution tarball):
    
        bash$ cd $BEEDIR/Net
        bash$ perl Makefile.PL LIB=$BEEDIR/lib
        bash$ make && make install
    
    This will configure libNet perl module, compile C sources and
    installs .pm and .so files into $BEEDIR/lib directory.
    
 o  libData -- network data transfers
 
    This library is used for data transfers. To compile and install
    libData, do following:
    
        bash$ cd $BEEDIR/Data
        bash$ perl Makefile.PL LIB=$BEEDIR/lib
        bash$ make && make install
    
If all of these steps succeed, you have your system prepared for running BEE.
