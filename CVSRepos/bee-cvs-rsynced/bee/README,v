				  ****     Welcome :-)     ****


This project is still in the early development stages.
Some programming experience is necessary to use it.
Documentation should be better too (WYSIWID - what you see is what is done).

INSTALL
-------

You will need to build networking libraries Net and Data (included):

cd ...bee/Net
perl Makefile.PL LIB=...bee/lib
make && make install

cd ...bee/Data
perl Makefile.PL LIB=...bee/lib
make && make install


Additionaly, you will need following CPAN modules:
XML::Simple
DBI & DBD::mysql
FreezeThaw
..maybe others



OpenSSL KEYS
------------

BEE is supplied with Demo BEE Root Certification Authority key and
set of few working _demo_ keys signed by this authority. If you want to
use BEE in production environment, you have to generate your own
Root CA and appropriate set of keys.
Information about this are located in certs/README file

ARCHITECTURE
------------

BEE consists of per-host daemons -- dads -- handling creation and running
transformation processes -- bees. Choose machines with which you
want to share CPU resources or data sources and run dad daemons on them

Whole ETL process is modelled in XML 'task' file -- look at examples
in ...bee/client/demo/ directory. This file describes on which dads
should run which script, what to connect to it's inputs and where
to store script's outputs. 
Every ETL script is stored in separate file, linked from main 'task' 
file. It consists of Perl code embeded in descriptive XML data.
Look at examples, again (e.g. pass.xml, find.xml)...

All the time, there must be one or several machines running central
authority daemon -- auth. This handles access control lists, database
passwords, enumeration of data sources.

RUNNING BEE
-----------

GUI client for ETL is not done now (WYSIWID), but you can try to 
modify examples to write your transformation xml files and use 
program task.pl from ...bee/client to execute it.

These steps are neccessary for running bee

1) launch authorization [not necessary now]
	cd ...bee/auth
	vi conf.xml
	perl auth.pl

2) launch dad
	cd ...bee/dad
	perl dad.pl

3) launch some client:
	cd ...bee/client
	vi demo/demo.xml
	perl task.pl bench bench.scheme

	see bee/client and bee/client/demo/README file for examples
